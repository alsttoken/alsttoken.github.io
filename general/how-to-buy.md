# How to Buy

## Before you buy

You need to have a ALGO Wallet.  You could set up a wallet for free at:

1. [Algo Official Wallet](https://algorandwallet.com) (IOS or Android)
2. [Algosigner](https://www.purestake.com/technology/algosigner/) (Chrome extension)
3. [My Algo](https://wallet.myalgo.com)

And you need ALGO.  You could buy ALGO at CEX like Binance and Coinbase.  Then you need to withdraw the ALGO into your wallet set above.
